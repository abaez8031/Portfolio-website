								<h2 class="major">About</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/images.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>I've had an undeniable love for mathematics and technology for as long as I can remember. Since high school, becoming a software engineer was something that piqued my interest because it was a way to combine my passion for problem-solving with my fascination with the intricacies of technology.</p>

								<p>However, life took an unexpected turn, and I've dedicated the past decade to supporting my father in managing his retail business and eventually taking the reins of my own venture. I absorbed invaluable lessons in effective leadership, operational efficiency, and fostering strong client relationships.
								</p>
									
								<p>Despite the detour in my career path, my undeniable love for mathematics and technology never faded. Now armed with a unique blend of an entrepreneurial mindset, leadership experience, and deep technical proficiency I feel that I am well equipped to create innovative software solutions that push boundaries, solve complex problems, and make a meaningful impact in the world of technology.</p>
